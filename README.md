# Ragpi Slack integration

Ragpi's Slack integration allows you to easily connect your technical documentation and knowledge base to your Slack workspace. By deploying a Slack bot powered by Ragpi, users can ask questions and receive AI-assisted answers directly in Slack.

Check out the [Ragpi Slack integration documentation](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/slack) to learn more about how to set up and use the integration.

You can also visit the [Core Ragpi Repo](https://github.com/ragpi/ragpi) to learn more about project.
